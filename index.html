                <h2>Here are a few highlights from Elon Musk's life:</h2>
                <p>Born on 28th June 1971 in South Africa. Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a South African-born,
                    Canadian-American business magnate, engineer, inventor and investor.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Blastar was a game written by Elon Musk in 1984 (at the age of 12). The source code was published in
                    a magazine and he received $500 for it.</p>

                    <ion-icon name="ellipsis-vertical-outline"></ion-icon>
                </div>
                <p>With US$28,000 money borrowed from Musk's father, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri started
                    online software startup Zip2 in 1995. They set up shop in Palo Alto in a small rented office. For
                    the newspaper publishing sector, the company created and sold an Internet city guide including maps,
                    directions, and yellow pages. Musk claims that he couldn't afford an apartment before the company
                    became popular, so he rented an office, slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one
                    computer with his brother.</p>
